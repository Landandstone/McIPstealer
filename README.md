# Ip Gleaner aka Fun Mod

e "FunMod" is a cunningly crafted tool compatible with both Forge and Spigot, designed to surreptitiously extract player IP addresses upon their unsuspecting ingress into the Minecraft server. Providing the dubious flexibility to covertly dispatch these gleaned IPs to a designated server of choice or stash them clandestinely as JSON files, this plugin operates under the veil of playful customization. Through its cloak of configurability, cunning administrators can manipulate its settings to their deceptive advantage, wielding player data for dubious purposes across the realms of both Forge and Spigot Minecraft servers.
